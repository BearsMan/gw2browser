On the break
------------

I'm going to hold develop this software, due to I have been conscripted to do military services
for 2 years (1/5/2014 - 1/5/2016) if any one feel like to continue this, feel free to folk it! :)
if you continue this project, I suggest to re-design Gw2Browser code architecture first
so it will be easy to expand in the future. secondly port or rewrite the model renderer to OpenGL,
and make it run on Windows, MacOS X, Linux (you need to fix gw2DatTools tho.)

See you later! *waves*

Gw2Browser
==========

Opens a Guild Wars 2 .dat file and allows the user to browse and extract its
files. Currently it supports viewing power-of-two textures, JPEG and WebP Images,
models, and binary files.

When a .dat file is opened, it will first index the file. This makes it *a lot*
faster to re-open the same .dat. Unfortunately, every time the .dat changes it
will have to be re-indexed (for now).

Keep in mind that if you keep tree items expanded while the indexer is running,
or while an index is being read, the process is *a lot* slower.

The latest binary can always be found [Here](http://goo.gl/4xMRVF)

For people who can't run Gw2Browser, download and Install
[Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
choose vcredist_x64.exe for 64bit and vcredist_x86.exe for 32bit executable.

And if it still didn't run, download and install
[DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)

Usage
-----

It can be started with:

    Gw2Browser <input dat>

If `<input dat>` is given, the program will open the file as soon as it starts.

Known issues
------------

* **Model rendering is very experimental.** Viewing one may crash the
browser, or it may not. It might also use the wrong texture, or it might not.
It entirely depends on what model you view, as some models don't have any
references to textures (mostly equipment models). Some models also use the
second UV channel for rendering while the shader in the browser only uses the
first. Loading any model is also *far* from optimized!

* **Non-power-of-two dimensions on non-DDS textures are unsupported at the
moment.** Decompressing one produces garbage blocks, so viewing them is
disabled until the reason has been determined.

* **Garbage code architecture!** todo : reducing the god objects and moving
privates out of the header files, etc.

Libraries and restrictions
--------------------------

The application is written specifically for MSVC10+, as it links with DirectX 9
and gw2DatTools. It also uses some C++11 features available in said compiler,
since gw2DatTools won't compile without those features anyway.

### Required libraries

* [DirectX SDK June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
* [gw2DatTools](https://github.com/kytulendu/gw2DatTools)
* [wxWidgets 3.0.0](http://wxwidgets.org/)
* [OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) *Included*
* [OpenGL Mathematics](http://glm.g-truc.net/) *Included*
* [libwebp](https://code.google.com/p/webp/) *Included*

### Optional libraries

* [Visual Leak Detector](http://vld.codeplex.com/)

If you want to use Visual Leak Detector, remove the "//" at #include <vld.h>
in Gw2Browser.cpp.

How to compile
--------------

Windows:
* Compile libwebp using Visual Studio Native Tools Command Prompt, both 32 and 64 bit
by use these command at libweb directory.

`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=debug-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`
`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=debug-dynamic RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`
`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=release-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`
`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=release-dynamic RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`

* Compile wxWidgets.
* Compile Gw2Browser using Visual Studio solution.
