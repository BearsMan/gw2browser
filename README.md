On the break
------------

Due to I have been conscripted to do military services for 2 years (1/5/2014 - 1/5/2016)
I may or may not continue to develop Gw2Browser during that time. If you think waiting
is long and want to continue this project, feel free to folk it ;)

See you later! * waves *

Gw2Browser
==========

Opens a Guild Wars 2 .dat file and allows the user to browse and extract its
files. Currently it supports power-of-two textures, JPEG and WebP Images, models,
126x64 ATEX textures, sound, strings and binary files.

When a .dat file is opened, it will first index the file. This makes it *a lot*
faster to re-open the same .dat. Unfortunately, every time the .dat changes it
will have to be re-indexed (for now).

Keep in mind that if you keep tree items expanded while the indexer is running,
or while an index is being read, the process is *a lot* slower.

The latest binary can always be found [Here](http://goo.gl/4xMRVF)

For people who can't run Gw2Browser, download and Install
[Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
choose vcredist_x64.exe for 64bit and vcredist_x86.exe for 32bit executable.

And if it still didn't run, download and install
[DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)

Usage
-----

It can be started with:

    Gw2Browser <input dat>

If `<input dat>` is given, the program will open the file as soon as it starts.

Known issues
------------

* **Model rendering is very experimental.**
Viewing one may crash the browser, or it may not. It might also use the wrong texture,
or it might not. It entirely depends on what model you view, as some models don't have
any references to textures (mostly equipment models). Some models also use the
second UV channel for rendering while the shader in the browser only uses the
first. Loading any model is also *far* from optimized!

* **Non-power-of-two textures are unsupported at the moment.**
Decompressing one produces garbage blocks. well, except 126x64 ATEX files.
Probably they use custom format for NPOT texture.

* **Some times after the finish re-index .dat file, some of catalog is missing**
Restart Gw2Browser will fix this issue.

Libraries and restrictions
--------------------------

The application is written specifically for MSVC10+, as it links with DirectX 9
and gw2DatTools. It also uses some C++11 features available in said compiler,
since gw2DatTools won't compile without those features anyway.

### Required libraries

* [DirectX SDK June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
* [gw2DatTools](https://github.com/kytulendu/gw2DatTools)
* [gw2formats](https://github.com/kytulendu/gw2formats)
* [wxWidgets 3.0.1](http://wxwidgets.org/)
* [OpenGL Mathematics](http://glm.g-truc.net/) *Included*
* [libwebp](https://code.google.com/p/webp/) *Included*

### Optional libraries

* [Visual Leak Detector](http://vld.codeplex.com/)

If you want to use Visual Leak Detector, remove the "//" at #include <vld.h>
in Gw2Browser.cpp.

How to compile
--------------

Windows:
* Compile libwebp using Visual Studio Native Tools Command Prompt, both 32 and 64 bit
by use these command at extern\libweb directory.

`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=debug-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`

`nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=release-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj`

* Compile wxWidgets.
* Compile Gw2Browser.
