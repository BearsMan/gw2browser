### Building with Visual Studio

#### Compile wxWidgets:

* Use solution file corresponding with your VS version in directory `wxWidgets-3.2.4/build/msw`.
  For example, VS2022 is `wx_vc17.sln`, if there is no corresponding solution file for your newer VS,
  just open the highest version of solution file available.

#### Make libmpg123 library:

* Open a `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` or `x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`
  and change it's directory to mpg123's directory.

* Rename export definition file by using this command.

      ren libmpg123-0.dll.def libmpg123-0.def

* Build the library.

  for 64 bit binary, use this command.

      lib /MACHINE:X64 /DEF:libmpg123-0.def /OUT:libmpg123-0.lib

  for 32 bit binary, use this command.

      lib /DEF:libmpg123-0.def /OUT:libmpg123-0.lib

#### Compile libwebp:

* Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`
  If you want to compile 32 bit library, use `x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` instread.

* Change directory to `gw2browser/extern/libweb`

* Use this command to compile libwebp

      nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=debug-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj
      nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=release-static RTLIBCFG=dynamic OBJDIR=obj

#### Compile freetype:

* Create vc2022 directory in `gw2browser/extern/freetype/builds/windows`

* Copy all content from vc2010 directory to vc2022 directory

* Open `freetype.sln` solution file in `gw2browser/extern/freetype/builds/windows/vc2022` with VS 2022

* Choose `Debug Static` or `Release Static` configuration and choose to Win32 for 32 bit build or x64 for 64 bit build
  from two dropdown box in Visual Studio toolbar.

* Press F7 or in MenuBar -> Build -> Build Solution to compile freetype.

#### Compile tinyxml2:

* Open cmake-gui, put path of directory `gw2browser/extern/tinyxml2` to `Where is the source code:`

* Create a directory named `build-vc` in `gw2browser/extern/tinyxml2`

* Put path of directory `gw2browser/extern/tinyxml2/build-vc` to `Where to build the binaries`

* Click `Configure` button

* Choose `Visual Studio 17 2022` then click `OK`

* Click `Generate` button

* Open `tinyxml2.sln` solution file in `gw2browser/extern/tinyxml2/build-vc`

* Choose Debug or Release configuration.

* Press F7 or in MenuBar -> Build -> Build Solution to compile tinyxml2.

#### Compile gw2browser:

* Open `gw2browser.sln` solution file in `gw2browser/prj`.

* Choose Debug or Release configuration and choose to Win32 for 32 bit build or x64 for 64 bit build
  from two dropdown box in Visual Studio toolbar.

* Press F7 or in MenuBar -> Build -> Build Solution to compile gw2browser.

#### Copy required binaries:

* Copy `soft_oal.dll` from `openal-soft/bin/Win32` or `openal-soft/bin/Win64` directory to `gw2browser/bin` and rename it to `OpenAL32.dll`

* Copy `libmpg123-0.dll` from mpg123 directory to `gw2browser/bin`

### Building with TDM-GCC

Make sure you have Cmake in your path.

Download TDM-GCC and install it to any location, for example `C:\TDM-GCC-64`.

You must also add TDM-GCC to your path.

for example set your path to `%path%;C:\TDM-GCC-64\bin`

#### Make libmpg123 library:

* Open `libmpg123-0.def` with any text editor, like Notepad++ and insert this to the first line.

      LIBRARY libmpg123-0.dll

  It will look some thing like this.

      LIBRARY libmpg123-0.dll
      EXPORTS
      mpg123_add_string
      ...

* Open Git Bash command line window and change directory to mpg123 directory and use these command.

      dlltool -d libmpg123-0.def -l libmpg123-0.a

#### Compile wxWidgets:

* Open Git Bash command line window and change directory to `wxWidgets-3.2.4/build/msw` and use these command.

      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=debug SHARED=1

  If it give error, re-type it again.
  Wait for it to finish, then use these command.

      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1

  This will build wxWidgets in debug and release configuration as a dynamiclink library.
  If you want static library, remove `SHARED=1` from the commandline. But you have to change
  library search path in CodeBlocks project file from `gcc_dll` to `gcc_lib`.

      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=debug
      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release

* If you need to rebuild, use "clean" target first.

      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=debug SHARED=1 clean
      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 clean
      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=debug clean
      mingw32-make -j 4 -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release clean

#### Compile glew:

* Open Git Bash command line window and change directory to `gw2browser/extern/glew` and use these command

      cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ./build/cmake
      mingw32-make
