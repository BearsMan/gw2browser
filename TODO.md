TODO list
=========

* "Find by fileId" dialog (seems easy for me to do it :P).

* Some restructuring. Decouple views from their data, for instance. Clean up 
headers, etc.

* Rewrite model renderer to OpenGL, run natively on MacOSX or Linux!
(I will try, with my beginner level skill!)

* Support for sub-items, where a file in the .dat can contain child-entries in
the index. This is needed for bank files, EULA, and to a certain degree also
for sound files.

* Allow individual file types to add entries to the context menu. For example,
models could get an *export with textures* option.

* Support for sound files.

* Support for string files. *partial done, need it's viewer*

* Support for model LODs, collision mesh rendering, bone, animation and more.

* Support for text manifest files.

* Support for text voice files

* Support for paged image files.

* External file name database, for known files (such as the exe and dll files).

* Support for R32f DDS files.

* Support NPOT textures.

* Support map files, map renderer.
